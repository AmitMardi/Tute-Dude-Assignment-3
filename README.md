# Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This Python program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a non-negative integer when prompted.
3. The program will display the factorial of the entered number.

**Note:**  
- Factorial of 0 or 1 is always 1.  
- The program uses recursion to compute the factorial.


# Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This Python program performs three mathematical operations using the `math` module:  
- Calculates the square root of a number.  
- Calculates the natural logarithm (log base e) of a number.
- Calculates the sine of a number in radians.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted (Enter a number:)
3. The program will display:
   - The square root of the number.
   - The natural logarithm of the number.
   - The sine of the number in radians.

**Note:**  
- The input should be positive for square root and logarithm.  
- The sine function takes the value as radians, not degrees.
